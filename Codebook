Assigned the "features.txt" file to the "features" variable name and made them character class. 

assigned the "X_train.txt" file to "train_x" variable with header = FALSE and sep = ' '
assigned the "y_train.txt" file to "train_activity" variable with header = FALSE and sep = ' '
assigned the "subject_train.txt" file to "train_subject" variable with header = FALSE and sep = ' '

combined the three variables: "train_x", "train_activity", and "train_subject", to a data frame using data.frame. 
using names function on the train data frame, set the names of the variables to "subject" and "activity". 

do the same with the "X_test.txt", "y_test.txt", and "subject_test.txt" files and name the dataset "test". Set the names "subject" and "Activity" 

using rbind, bind the data sets "train" and "test" into a data frame called "data"

find the mean and standard deviation for each of the variables in "features" using grep function and assign it to "mean_std"

create a data frame called "msdata" which is a subsection of the data frame "data" with the columns 1,2,mean_std + 2

read.table on the file "activity_labels.txt" with header = FALSE and assign to activity_labels
using as.character function, make the activity_labels column 2 into character class
then assign the activity_labels to msdata$activity

using names fundciton, set the names of "msdata" dataframe and assign it to "reName"
using the gsub function, rename:
  ^t to TimeDomain_
  ^f to FrequencyDomain_
  Acc to Accelerometer
  Gyro to Gyroscope
  Mag to Magnitude
  -mean- to _Mean_
  -std- to _StandardDeviation_
  and - to _
  
  using the aggregate function, create a data set with "msdata" columns 3:81, averages for each activity and subject with FUN = mean
  
  using write.table, make the new data set a file names dataSet2 with row.names = FALSE.
